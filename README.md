# random-slide
Scrapes Slideshare and pulls a random slide.

## How it works
This searches [slideshare.net](https://slideshare.net) with [random English words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words), pulls a random result, and chooses a random slide
from the given slide show. The response gives basic information on the slideshow as well as the slide URL.
